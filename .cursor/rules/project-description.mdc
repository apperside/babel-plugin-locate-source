This is a custom babel plugin that adds the following HTML attributes to JSX elements in development mode:

- `data-at`: The source file and line numbers (e.g., "Button.tsx:42-45")
- `data-is`: The component name (e.g., "Button")
- `data-in`: The parent component where this JSX appears (e.g., "Header")

so you will never waste time again guessing from which point of your source code is coming a specific DOM element
